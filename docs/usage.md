# Negative Usage

Negative is made for anybody needs to compare two things on a computer screen. Developers can compare their design implementations (browsers, simulators, etc.) with documents from designers. They can compare browser agains browser or PSD against PSD. And it's the perfect solution for comparing frames in an animation

## Capture / Clear
Capture the screen with `Command + G`, or clear the view with `Command + Delete`.

## Hide / Show (global)
If Negative is in your way, you can hide it **from any app** with `Command + Control + H`. When you want to show it, `Command + Control + H` again.

## Move

### Arrow Keys
Keep your hands on the keyboard! Use the arrow keys alone to nudge Negative 1 pixel in any direction. If you're going far, hold down `Shift` to jump by 10 pixels.

### Drag
If you'd rather use the mouse or trackpad, Negative can be moved by clicking and dragging inside the "frame" view. Dragging on tabs will only allow you to rearrange your tabs.

## Dark Mode / Light Mode
Sometimes it's easier to see the edge of your capture against a light-colored background. Use `Command + D` to toggle between Dark and Light modes.

## Tabs
Tabs. Because you need tabs.

## Zoom
Zooming isn't really necessary yet because the pixel ratio of the captured screen does not matter. If Negative is used on a retina display, the image will be resize down (using CSS) to the 1x resolution. Otherwise, the image will stay its original resolution. This feature is really just preparation for allowing arbitary images to be opened with Negative.
